# EMI-calculator-apk
This program defines two functions: calculate_emi() and main(). The calculate_emi() function takes the principal amount, annual interest rate, and tenure as inputs and returns the calculated EMI. The main() function prompts the user for the required information, calls the calculate_emi() function, and displays the result.
